      <p>Sunburn is a form of radiation burn that affects living tissue, such as skin, that results from an overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, commonly from the sun. Common symptoms in humans and other animals include red or reddish skin that is hot to the touch, pain, general fatigue, and mild dizziness. An excess of UV radiation can be life-threatening in extreme cases. Excessive UV radiation is the leading cause of primarily non-malignant skin tumors.</p>

      <p>Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[10] There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma.[1] The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).[5][11] Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.[5] It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer.[1] Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread.[5] It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer.[2] Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.</p>
